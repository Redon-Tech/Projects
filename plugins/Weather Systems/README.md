# Weather-Systems
This is the modified version of TwentyTwoPilots Weather Systems that actually works. [GitHub](https://github.com/Redon-Tech/Weather-Systems)

# Info
This project uses RoJo, rojo does not give you UI elements so use the releases page to get the latest RBXLX file.

Uploading the script as a Roblox plugin it works.

We are starting a V2.0 eventually.
